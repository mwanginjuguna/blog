# Growing Plants 101 - Understanding the Basic **Requirements, Processes, and Outcomes of How Plants Grow**

Humans, animals, bacteria, insects, birds, viruses, fungi, and plants are all living things. You probably already know where humans and animals get their food, right? **Where?**

Animals, people included, get their food from plants, other animals - _(where I come from, humans do not eat humans)_, and from other living creatures like birds and insects.

Here is a test, (don't fail):

> Where do plants get food from?

- [ ] Soil
- [ ] Dead plants and Dead Animals
- [ ] Sun
- [ ] Air
- [ ] Seed

Don't worry if the above choices seem trivial. In most cases, we are taught that plants get their food from the soil. This is not entirely correct, especially for green plants, and I will demonstrate why in a moment.

One of the major differences between plants and animals is plants' ability to manufacture their own food(VanDerZanden, 2008), through the process called **photosynthesis**, which means _"to put together with light."_

This however, does not mean that soil and other nutrients in the soil (from manure and fertilizers) are not important for plant growth. Basically, there is no wrong answer to our question: `where do plants food come from?` - Because it is multiple sources.

The gaol of this extensive discussion, is to present a detailed step-by-step analysis of how plants grow, highlighting the processes of photosynthesis, soil, nutrients, and microorganisms. We will also look at how humans can help plants grow better.

By the end of this lesson, you will learn and understand:

- How plants grow.
- The role of Carbon dioxide, Water and Sunlight in plant growth.
- The role of Soil and soil microorganisms in plant growth.
- You will have enough information to help you make decisions relating to growing and monitoring the growth of healthy crops at your farm to improve productivity.

Let's get into it.

## Understanding **How Plants Grow**

### The Seed

Plant growth starts with the seed. You sow your seeds and they germinate to become plants or crops in the farm. The only requirements for seeds in moisture, and the right temperatures _(technically, moisture will rarely exist in extreme temperatures)_.

The seed contains enough energy to provide the necessary resources for the initial stages of germination, allowing the seedling to establish itself before it can engage in photosynthesis. This tells us that the seed does not need any external fertilizers, or nutrients until the initial stages of germination are completed.

### Water, Light, and Carbon-dioxide(Air)

> All plants have roots, stem, and leaves.

After successful germination, the plant is ready to start manufacturing food through the process of _photosynthesis_.

The plant take Carbon-dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>) from Air through its leaves,  and Water(H<sub>2</sub>0) from the ground through its roots. Water and carbon-dioxide are combined with with sunlight to make glucose or carbohydrate/starch(CHO). This is the process of photosynthesis, which converts photo energy from sunlight, into chemical energy that can be transported.

In science, photosynthesis is represented as follows:

Carbon dioxide + Water + Sunlight = Sugar(glucose) + Oxygen

or

6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>0 + Energy => C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>0<sub>6</sub> + 60<sub>2</sub>

The glucose (sugar) is transported from the leaves to the other parts of the plants where it is used, stored, or converted into complex energy compounds such as oils and proteins.

Therefore, this glucose or sugar, is the primary source of food for the plant and all its parts. The food products that the plant manufactures from this glucose are called _photosynthates_. The plant uses these foods when light is limited, or transports them to its roots or developing fruits.

The excess glucose or sugar which is not needed immediately by the plant is transported to the roots, fruits, or seeds.

Fruits are used by the plants as energy reserves (food storage areas) to be used later.

Seeds on the other hand, are used to store glucose for reproduction purposes. This is the reason we found earlier that seeds do not require external sources of nutrients until the plant has gone through the early stages of germination.

The rest of the sugar is transported to the roots.

## The Roots of the Plant

The roots play a very important role to support the healthy growth of the plant. The most obvious function of the roots is to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. Another common function is supporting the plant firmly into the soil to prevent uprooting by wind.

Additionally, the roots also transport nutrients and water to the upper parts of the plant such as the stem and leaves.

Other functions we will look at deeply include storage of glucose/sugar and other nutrients, Production of root exudates, and Interaction with soil microorganisms.

### Storage of sugar and nutrients

Similar to fruits and seeds, the roots also act as storage organs for reserve nutrients and carbohydrates. Plants can store excess sugars, starches, and other nutrients in their roots during periods of abundant resources. These reserves can be mobilized during times of stress or when additional energy is needed for growth and reproduction.

For example, potatoes and carrots among other tubers, use their roots as storage reserves and also as seeds for reproduction purposes.

### Production of root exudates

> Root exudates are organic compounds produced by plant roots and intentionally secreted or actively released into the soil.

This is one of the most important role of roots, and a demonstration of _plant intelligence_. It is important to note that root exudates are not waste products.

For a plant to grow, it must be aware of its environment, and also control that environment. This control is achieved through root exudates.

Here is a question: **Why do plants need to produce root exudates (these organic compounds)_ which are not wastes, and release them to the soil - intentionally?**

To answer this question, we need to know what are the components of root exudates.

According to Koo, Adriano, Bolan, and Barton (2005), _root exudates are a mixture of soluble organic substances, which may contain **sugars, amino acids, organic acids, enzymes, and other substances**_. The specific composition can vary among plant types and can be influenced by environmental conditions.

#### Functions of Roots exudates

- Firstly, they play a key role in _nutrient mobilization_, as certain compounds released by roots, such as organic acids, enhance the solubility of minerals in the soil, making them more accessible for plant uptake.
- These exudates foster microbial interactions in the rhizosphere(area around the plant) by _attracting specific microorganisms_. This symbiotic relationship contributes to nutrient cycling, enhances disease resistance, and promotes overall soil health.
- Root exudates also _influence neighboring plants_, by strategically releasing chemicals to affect the growth of surrounding species, establishing a competitive environment by inhibiting the development of competing plants. This can discourage some plants from growing, or encourage other beneficial plants to grow.
- Additionally, the organic acids released can _modify the pH of the rhizosphere(area around the plant)_, impacting nutrient availability and microbial activity in the soil.

> **Note**: Rizosphere is the area around the plant, that the plant can influence or change by releasing or absobing nutrients.

From the above functions of the root exudates, we can conclude that they help the plant transact with the soil. First, the plant learns about its environment. Second, it sends specific organic compounds. These compound are consumed by (1.) microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, earthworms, etc. (2.) other plants living around the plant (rizosphere).

Therefore, the plant uses the root exudates to selectively control its environment. But why does the plant need to provide food for microorganisms?

This brings us to our next interesting component of plant growth. The _Soil Microorganisms_.

### Interaction with Microorganisms

Let's remember what we have learned this far.

> **Recap**

The first food consumed by the crop comes from the seed. After germination, the plant uses its new roots to fetch water from the roots. The water is transported to the leaves.

At the leaves of the young plant, photosynthesis combines water, carbon-dioxide (from air), and sunlight to create sugar/glucose (also called carbohydrates/starch) and oxygen.

The sugar is the original food or energy for the different parts of our plant. Extra sugar is stored in fruits, seeds, and roots.

The plant uses the roots to release some of this sugar into the soil as root exudates to feed microorganisms and control its surrounding environment (rizosphere).

**Now, let's get our hands dirty.** Let us talk about soil and microorganisms.

### What are Microorganisms?

Microorganisms or microbes are tiny living creatures that live as single cells or form colonies.

We find microbes in all types of environments including human skin, animal guts, rainfall, caves, plants, and soils. It is estimated that a single gram of soil can contain up to several billion bacteria. That is a lot of bacteria.

#### How Soil Microbes work

Microbes need an energy source, carbon, and other nutrients to grow and survive in their environment, just as humans require food. Many microbes use carbon-based materials as their energy source and to build their cells.

In soils, microbes get this carbon (food) from dead plant leaves and parts, glucose from plant roots (root exudates), and living or dead soil organisms, including other microbes, worms, and insects.

These carbon-based materials from living or dead living things are known as soil organic matter. Soil organic matter come two categories: "active"  and "stable".

- **Active soil organic matter** is ready to be consumed by the microorganisms or microbes. Microbes consume these directly from the soil.
- **Stable soil organic matter** cannot be directly consumed by the microorganisms and become a part of the soil minerals or aggregates. This makes them less prone to rapid decomposition. Stable organic matter contributes to soil structure, water retention, and long-term carbon sequestration; thus maintaining soil fertility and structure over time.

In other words, microbes or microorganisms, feed from decaying active organic matter to release nutrients and energy(glucose). These nutrients and glucose become food for the plants and other life forms in the soil.

#### How Microbes breakdown organic matter into nutrients(Plant food)

>The microbes/microorganisms break down complex organic compounds into simple nutrients for the plant to consume.

Microbes, including bacteria and fungi, consume organic matter as a source of energy and nutrients. By consuming the organic matter, the microbes secrete or produce enzymes. These enzymes break down complex organic compounds into simpler molecules.

The breakdown of organic matter results in the production of simpler organic compounds, such as organic acids, amino acids, and sugars, along with various byproducts.

Microbes utilize a portion of the broken-down organic matter for their own energy and growth. In the process, they produce metabolic byproducts, such as organic acids, enzymes, and other compounds, into the surrounding soil.

All these products from bacteria and other microbes are essential in developing and maintaining a healthy soil. For example, one of the products is organic acids which improve mineral solubility, making nutrients more available for plant uptake. This is what we need for our plants.

The breakdown of organic matter by microbes releases nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, along with other micronutrients, in a plant-available form.

Nutrients may exist in many forms. Not all nutrients can be consumed by the plant. Some become a part of the soil to contribute to soil structure. Others become food for bacteria and microbes, while the rest become food for the plants. For instance, nitrogen may be present as ammonium (NH4+) or nitrate (NO3-) depending on microbial activities.

> **Takeaway on Microbes**:
The soil consists of a many different microorganisms which contribute to essential soil and plant activities including nutrient recycling, protecting soil structure, and pathogen/disease suppression.

#### Plant Uptake

Plants absorb the nutrients released by microorganisms through their root systems, and transports them to different parts for growth and development.

They contribute to the plant's nutritional needs and support various physiological processes, including protein synthesis, cell division, and overall growth.

The remaining nutrients feed the microorganisms and build soil structure. Their presence in the soil increases root development in the plant. A large and healthy root system increases absorption of NPK nutrients and water, and also leads to larger plant size.

## Conclusion

That is it. That is the basic information showing us how crops grow.

**In Summary**:

* Seeds germinate to develop leaves and roots. The roots absorb water from the ground. The leaves capture sunlight and carbon dioxide.
* Photosynthesis occurs on the leaves. Carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight combine to create glucose/sugar(starch).
* Plant uses some of the sugar to promote growth and development of various parts. Additional sugar/glucose is stored in fruits(for future use) and seeds(for reproduction purpose).
* The roots release some of the suger as root exudates into the soil. Root exudates are used to control the plants environment(rizosphere).
* Microorganisms in the soil ingest the released sugars among other organic matter in the soil. The microbes breakdown the organic matter into simple nutrient compounds.
* Some of the nutrients released by the microbes are absorbed by the plants. Other more complex produces of microbes become food for other microbes, or become part of the soil to enhance soil structure and encourage root development.
* Plants utilize nutrients availble in the soil (from microbes and fertilizers) to supplement the sugar produced and stored from photosysnthesis to achieve its growth requirements.

At the end of the day, a healthy plant has access to enough sunlight (_to optimize photosynthesis_), and a rich soil ecosystem with diverse microbes (_for high nutrient concentration_). Access to required nutrients and efficient photosysnthesis are the two main requirements for plant growth.

In today's world, we must find ways to grow our plants and crops in a sustainable way. In our day-to-day farming activities, we must aim to improve soil health, to provide our crops with the nutrients they need, when they need.

Healthy soil equals healthy plants. This leads to more crop yields, beautiful farms, a healthy environment, and bigger pockets.

**Healthy plants, Healthy people.**
