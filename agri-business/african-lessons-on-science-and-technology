# Forgotten Lessons Our African Ancestors Teach us about Science and Technology (you won't learn this in school)

Technology is the heart of a community. As Africans, we must rethink how we use technology. I go back and forth from our ancestors to today's societies to gather important lessons.

## Science is the Foundation of Building Communities

A common belief is that technology did not exist in traditional societies. Specifically in the case of Africa, many people, especially Africans, believe technology arrived in Africa during the era of colonialism.

Our education system teaches us to think about the traditional African society as a primitive generation without technology and science. We are taught that if you came to Africa in that era, you would meet people who did not use any form of technology. This perspective is disturbing and false, I dare say **ignorant**.

**Pre-colonial Africans used science and technology to grow their communities and advance their well-being**. This is a difficult truth to defend. _To understand traditional science and technology, we must first understand what technology is and is not._

### What is Technology?

Technology is the **use of tools and resources available to improve quality of life**. Science means **understanding nature** and taking advantage of that understanding **to change or improve life**.<br>Were you taught this as the meaning of technology at your school? I was not. I was given some long and boring definitions of technology and science.

Technology and science are the most practical tools used to build any community. Technology does not have to be big machines, smart devices, or automatic guns. If you can solve a problem by merely understanding nature and using that knowledge to take action, you are a **scientist**.<br>

#### How we use science and technology today vs how our ancestors did

If you look into the history of our ancestors, before the Europeans came to Africa, they used simple tools compared to what we have today. In farming, simple hand tools _pangas_ (machetes), _jembes_ (plows), hoes, and axes comprised the majority of technology. In today's farms, most of these tools still dominate in rural farming, with a growing increase in modern computerized machineries making their way to our farms.

My point here is simple. Our forefathers used technology that was accessible and appropriate to their needs to improve the quality of their lives. In the same way we use technology today for communication, health, fitness, farming, war, and work, our ancestors made tools that were specialized for their community at that time.
## Technology is a Tool not a Solution

There is increasing and overwhelming evidence that shows our forefathers lived quality lives compared to our present communities. **Today, we pride ourselves as more advanced and better equipped with science and technology to improve quality of life. Yet, it is in our present generation that the leading cause of death is lifestyle diseases**. How can we explain this? Despite the availability of technology, advanced science, and high-quality educational materials, present-day African societies are struggling with problems that were contained by our forefathers. Again, what do we say about this?

My answer takes us back to understanding what technology is and its place in society. **We must look at technology as a tool for improving life within a community.**<br>
Technology improves the community. It is not a tool or a blueprint for creating a new community.

People decide what kind of a community they want. Then, they use science and technology to build that community.

In the case of our forefathers taboos, values, laws, and agreements with God and Spirits were used to decide the community structure. These components created unity in life between people and the natural world. <br>Many people criticize religion practice in Africa and even condemn it as a contributing factor in underdevelopment. Religion, technology, and science are all but tools for building a community. They can be used to do good. They can be misused to manipulate others. They can be used to do evil.

Today, our communities are largely decided by the government through a constitution. The constitution establishes the ambitions, interests, and traditions of the state, just the same way taboos and values define the traditions of our ancestors. Therefore, technology should be the tools we create to achieve these goals, interests, and ambitions that are envisioned through our constitutions.

## The Problem with the use of Technology in Africa

Our communities today lack control of science and technology. If I come to your house and I see something I like, the first thought is _"I want to go buy that"_. The problem with this thought is I don't know why you bought it in the first place. In Gikuyu community, there is a great saying that **Ndiakagwo ta ya wakini** loosely translates to _You don't build your house like your age-mate or friend._

Today's technology in Africa is merely copy-pasting the world. We import all the technologies we use today. And I am not talking about just the devices or machines, I mean the ideology, traditions, and lifestyles.

## How to use Technology to Develop Africa

**The greatest sin in life is lack of originality.**
<br>
Our ancestors represented an original confident generation of Africans. They did things their way, even when their way was considered inferior.

The technology of our ancestors emphasized the quality of life as measured in terms of people, community, and spiritual experience. Individuals were confident of what they could do and achieve for their community. This confidence is hard to find today.

This confidence was taken away by foreign modernization and education. There is nothing wrong with this technology. There is something wrong with how and why we use it in Africa. The way Africa adopts foreign technology is subversive and materialistic. The large-scale importation of technology creates a **massive importation syndrome** which conditions us to think our African communities are inferior and the foreign communities are superior.

You know the problems at your home better than anyone else which makes you the best person to solve those problems. I am not saying that Africa needs to go back to the old technologies. All trying to say, if I am saying anything, is that we **Africans need to build the technology that will solve their problems using present-day science.**

We understand each other better. We understand our villages better. We have the scientific education to create technologies of any scale. So why are we not doing it?

### We are not poor, we just lack the ambition to solve our African problems

**If you googled why Africa is poor, it is because there is no development. If you google why there is no development, it is because Africa is poor.**

We have enough resources to build what we need. **Hell, the whole world is fighting to get the African resources.** That is something to tell you we are not poor.

Ambition is not wanting to be successful. It is wanting to solve a problem. And right now, the problem we must solve is building technology for Africa.

This means building manufacturing capacity to support production of the machinery and computing power we need to build better communities. This translates to establishing working systems to help people living in rural areas get their produce to our developing urban centers.
<br>
<br>
Our ambition must result in helping small businesses digitize their services and reach more customers. This is what an ambitious African technology should be about.

We must look into technology from what we need first, and not what our friends have.

We must rethink our current experience of technology and science. Science and technology are tools. We must view and use them as such.

Technology is the real way out, and the only way up for Africa.
