# Blog Posts

> I am Francis Njuguna.

My goal is to deconstruct complex topics into simple bit-size content. I help everyday people deeply connect with topics that are mostly considered difficult. Everybody can understand anything if it is explained well. Beyond writing, I enjoy writing software and web applications for businesses. From websites and landing pages, to e-commerce sytems and automation scripts, there is always something we can do together. Check out [my portfolio of projects on GitHub](https://mwanginjuguna.github.io/portfolio) or send me an email at [francis.kanothe@gmail.com](mailto::francis.kanothe@gmail.com).

This blog hosts a curated list of tutorials, guides, explainers, opinions, and other articless on Software Engineering, Agriculture, Entrepreneurship, and Technology in general.

Enjoy.

## Computing and Software Engineering Topics

Computers are everywhere. More people are connected now more than ever. As a software developer, I want to understand technology and explain computing tools to experts and every-day people.

## Agriculture and Farming Topics

Agriculture is the backbone of the global economy and human sustenance. Everyday, climate change combined with poor farming methods threaten the very core of our lives. I am committed to unearthing the true nature of practicing agriculture. In this quest, my desire is to research and share practical knowledge and actionable tips that farmers can integrate in day-to-day farming.

I believe science and technology are not be replacements for natural practices in agriculture. They are tools that empower our ability to solve problems that face the continuity natural farming methods, challenges of climate change, and deterioration of soil fertility. These problems can be solved if we harness knowledge of growing crops sustainably to feed our growing population. However, we MUST approach the challenge of feeding the world as a challenge in adopting sustainable agriculture, and not substituting agricultural products.

## Entrepreneurship and Digital/online Business

Technology is the most important asset in business today. The success of any entreoreneurship is largely determined by integration of technology. Technology gives us a unique tooling to advance our business practices through automation of repetitive processes, data analysis and visualization to help make better business decisions, and a global reach to expand client base and take advantage of global shipping networks to sell products anywhere in the world.

For developing countries, small businesses, and rural areas, technology is a great accelerating force that is helping startups compete globally and grow rapidly. It is my goal to harness technology skills, explain technologies, and demonstrate to businesses how technology is a game-changer in their entrepreneurship journey.
