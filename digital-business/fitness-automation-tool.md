Today, more than ever, **automation is the most desired and sought after component of any business**; and the personal fitness business is no exception. Automation is the answer to these frustrations and many more frustrations every fitness trainer has to experience.

But automation tools nowadays come in all sort of things. The market is flooded with many of the so called automation tools: from CRMs for customer management, a professional website showcase your services and attract new clients, to E-commerce platforms to sell and manage orders for your products and workouts, and many more tools out there.

All these tools are great. But they bring one big challenge: You have to buy or subscribe to many things, which consume time and money. Instead of helping you free time to help your clients achieve their goals, you spend your free time toggling from one platform to another, copy-pasting data from this website to that other one, and more. Eventually this becomes too much work and takes up so much of your time that you just give up on the so called `Automation tools`.

Automation should be like a calculator. When you buy a calculator, you don't need 10 other things. Your calculator will do all sort of math, even the ones you don't know exist. It is a single tool that automates all calculation problems.
